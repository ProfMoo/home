# TODO

1. Get beets running in a docker image so that it's more easily repeatable
2. Work on a script that does everything I'd like on import:
   1. Import
   2. Get album art
   3. Get genre
   4. Fix years
3. Have Lidarr download albums automatically, then Beets automatically moves that into the final location with all the right tags
   1. Need to figure out how to tell beets to accept albums AS IS when it can't find anything
   2. Beets currently asks for permission when importing album artwork, which fails because of no STDIN. Need to fix that (check sakuraburst album for live example)

# TO TRY NEXT

1. Mixtapes from more underground rappers
2. The Skrillex disco dump
3. Mura Masa random singles
4. the heart and the tongue - chance the rapper
5. 28 mansions
