# Lidarr

Community Guide: <https://wiki.servarr.com/lidarr/community-guide>

Overall, I see 3 main things to figure out before I can use Lidarr full-time:

1. Moving forward (i.e. future releases and new downloads), ensuring that the beets config is uses (i.e. integrating beets and Lidarr). Seems it's possible to integrate beets into Lidarr: <https://github.com/RandomNinjaAtk/arr-scripts/blob/main/lidarr/readme.md>.
2. Importing my existing beets DB into Lidarr somehow (not sure how to do this yet).
3. Ensuring the Lidarr is accurate and consistent enough to match my manual imports (or get close).
